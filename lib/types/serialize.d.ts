/**
 * Serialize harness messages into a Kiro `generateAssistantResponse` request.
 *
 * Three properties of the wire operation drive the whole translation:
 *
 * - There is no system slot. The system prompt is prepended to the content of
 *   the first user turn. Models without a live effort schema retain the legacy
 *   thinking markers; discovered models receive their native request field.
 * - The last user turn is `currentMessage`, not a history entry, and
 *   `conversationState.history` must strictly alternate user, assistant, user,
 *   …, so gaps are filled with the same neutral padding the official client
 *   uses. Padding text must be ordinary: a distinctive system-looking marker is
 *   imitated by the model and then persisted as visible output.
 * - Tool results are per-turn context on the user message that carries them,
 *   and the service rejects a result whose `toolUseId` no history entry
 *   issued, so unmatched results degrade to text.
 *
